    <li>We do not track or collect data related to your usage patterns or activity within the app.</li>
    <li>We do not store any data that could personally identify you in any way.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
<p>
    Since we do not collect any personal information, we do not store or retain any user data. Any data or information you provide is not saved or retained by us, and your interactions with the app are processed in real-time.
</p>

<h2>3. Use of Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
    While we do not collect any personal data, our applications may integrate with third-party services for functionality, such as analytics or advertising. However, we do not use third-party services that track your personal data.
</p>
<p>Some third-party services we may use include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Google Analytics:</strong> To collect anonymous usage data and help us improve our app experience. This information does not include personal data such as your name or email address.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Advertising Networks:</strong> We may use third-party advertising networks (e.g., AdMob) to display ads within the app. These ads may use cookies or similar technologies to serve ads relevant to you. However, we do not collect or share any personal data for advertising purposes.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
<p>
    Our app does not use cookies or any tracking technologies that would collect your personal information.
</p>

<h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
    Our mobile applications are intended for users over the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information as soon as possible.
</p>

<h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
<p>As a user of our app, you have the right to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Request access to any information that may be associated with your use of the app (even though we do not collect any personal data).</li>
    <li>Withdraw consent to any collection of personal data (though no data is collected in the first place).</li>
    <li>Ask for the deletion of any personal information (though no such data exists in our systems).</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. When we update this policy, we will revise the "Effective Date" at the top of this page.
</p>

<h2>8. Security</h2>
<p>
    We take reasonable measures to ensure that your data is protected from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. However, as we do not store personal information, we do not store any information that would require protection.
</p>
